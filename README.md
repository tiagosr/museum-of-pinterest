# Museum of Pinterest

Virtual museums generated from your Pinterest boards.
A digital art installation where visitors can explore galleries of images from Pinterest boards within a procedurally generated museum, where the architecture and display disposition are generated at random.

Inspiration for the procedural museum spaces is at [this pinterest board](https://pinterest.com/tiagosr/museum-of-pinterest). Will be fun to see that from within a generated museum, soon :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
